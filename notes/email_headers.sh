## Email Importance / Priority

# You can add the X-Priority header field and give it the value string 
# "X-Priority","1″ This is the most common way of setting the priority of an email. 
# "3" is normal, and 
# "5" is the lowest. 
# "2″ and "4″ are in-betweens, 
# and frankly I’ve never seen anything but "1″ or "3″ used. 
# Microsoft Outlook adds these header fields when setting a message to High priority:

X-Priority: 1 (Highest)
X-MSMail-Priority: High
Importance: High

# I don’t think you’ll need all three, but you can add them all if you wish. 
# My recommendation is to only add the X-Priority header.
X-Priority: 1
