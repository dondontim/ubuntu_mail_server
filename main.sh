  ## Messages with a BODY over 100 â€“ 150 KB trigger spam filters. 
  # So, the common recommendation is to keep email body size between 15 KB and 100 KB.
  # Gmail clips emails that are larger than 102 KB. It supplies readers a link
  # if they want to view the complete email, 
  # but there's no guarantee your recipient will be willing to click it.
